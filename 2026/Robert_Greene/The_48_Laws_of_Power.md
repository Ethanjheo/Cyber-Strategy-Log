## 1. Core Definition

### Power

The ability to influence outcomes, control perception, and shape decisions within hierarchical systems.

Power is:
- Relational (exists between people)
- Positional (depends on hierarchy)
- Perceptual (depends on image and reputation)

---

## 2. Structural Premise

Power operates through recurring historical patterns.

The laws are not moral guidelines.  
They are strategic observations of how influence is gained and lost.

Core assumption:
Human behaviour under competition follows predictable tendencies.

---

## 3. Strategic Foundations

### Control Perception
- Reputation is leverage
- Visibility must be managed
- Image precedes reality

### Conceal Intention
- Transparency reduces advantage
- Information asymmetry creates power

### Protect Position
- Never threaten superior authority directly
- Build influence indirectly

### Manage Emotion
- Emotional reactions reduce strategic control
- Power requires detachment

---

## 4. Risk Awareness

Misuse of power laws leads to:
- Isolation
- Distrust
- Retaliation

The book emphasises calculation, not impulsiveness.

---

## 5. Central Thesis

Power is maintained by:

1. Perception management  
2. Strategic patience  
3. Controlled disclosure  
4. Hierarchical awareness  
5. Emotional discipline

Understanding power reduces vulnerability before increasing dominance.

# My Integrative Thinking: Security and the Book

1. In security, power is the level at which risk can be resolved.

2. Distribute risk = grant authority by separating accessible layers and dividing access levels.

3. In a company, security must not be prioritised over management.

4. Decisions should be made based on security data and risk models rather than emotion.

5. Develop long-term design capability.

6. Strategically lead the public emphasis on the importance of security.

7. Under legal grounds, build layered protection barriers to protect management.
