## Book Notes (Content-Focused Summary)

### Core Shift: From Spectacle to Discipline
Foucault’s opening scene—Damiens’ public execution—shows that pre-modern punishment operated as a visible ritual of sovereign power over the body.  
Modern punishment appears more humane and rational, but the central change is not the reduction of cruelty. It is the transformation of **where and how power operates**.

In modernity, power moves away from spectacular violence and into institutions that quietly shape behavior. Punishment becomes less about inflicting pain and more about producing compliant subjects through supervision, correction, and training.

### Institutions and Normalization
Disciplinary power is embedded across ordinary institutions, not only prisons:
- schools (rules and routines)
- workplaces (hierarchy and evaluation)
- hospitals, the military, factories (structured control)

Control often operates through **normalization**—standards of what is “average” or “acceptable.”  
Deviation is managed not only through punishment, but also through exclusion and social evaluation, which encourages self-regulation.

### Part III: Discipline and “Docile Bodies”
Foucault introduces **docile bodies**: bodies that are manipulable, trainable, and efficient—obedient and capable of self-regulation.  
Power optimizes individuals rather than eliminating them, shaping them through everyday routines and long-term disciplinary processes.

### Disciplinary Techniques (Key Set)
Foucault frames discipline as a technology of power, built through:
1) **Spatial organization** (the art of distributions)  
2) **Time and activity control** (timetables, routines)  
3) **Progressive training** (step-by-step evaluation, career ladders)  
4) **Forces composition** (optimizing individuals within the group)

### Mechanisms of Control
Discipline is reinforced through:
- **Hierarchical observation** (visibility, the possibility of being watched)
- **Normalizing judgment** (standards of normality)
- **The examination** (surveillance + judgment + documentation)

### Panopticism
Panopticism is the ideal form of disciplinary power:  
a system that leads individuals to behave as if they are always being observed, producing self-control with minimal direct force.

## Integrative Security Thinking Through *Discipline and Punish*

Absolute security is impossible.  
There is no such thing as zero security, and purely technical solutions inevitably reach their limits.

A significant portion of security incidents originates from human behavior rather than technical failure. 
This reveals that cybersecurity is not solely a technological problem, but also a behavioral and structural one.

My engagement with *Discipline and Punish* is rooted in this limitation of technical security.
Foucault’s analysis provides a framework for understanding how systems increase self-regulation by shaping behavior instead of relying on constant enforcement or punishment.

In cybersecurity governance, effective protection is achieved not by eliminating risk, but by designing structural environments in which secure behavior becomes internalized.
Through policy design, monitoring frameworks, and organizational norms, individuals are guided to act securely as a matter of routine rather than obligation.

From this perspective, security functions less as a mechanism of punishment and more as a form of governance.
Its objective is to construct systems that encourage stability, resilience, and self-enforced compliance through thoughtful structural design.

## My Reflection (To Be Written by Me)

Michel Foucault describes the transformation of how power controls people in modern society through the examples of various social institutions. He analyzes the differences in the operation of power between pre-modern societies and modern disciplined societies.

In pre-modern times, power controlled human behavior through direct physical punishment such as public executions. In contrast, modern power operates by guiding and regulating human behavior within institutions and social structures. This shift appears to have acquired ethical legitimacy on the surface, while evolving into a much more sophisticated and efficient form of control.

Institutional organizations such as the military, hospitals, factories, and schools discipline individuals’ ways of thinking and behaviors, leading them to internalize and conform to the norms of the institution. In this process, control is less visibly coercive and more internalized in everyday life.

These functions of surveillance and discipline are often justified in the name of maintaining social order and promoting stable societal growth. However, from a critical perspective, the way these mechanisms operate and the effects they produce may vary depending on the intentions of policymakers.

When comparing cultural differences, Western societies tend to distinguish between individual time and collective time, whereas many East Asian societies tend to treat personal time and group time as inseparable (Edward T. Hall’s high-context vs. low-context culture framework).

Considering these cultural differences, one might question whether the legitimacy of surveillance and discipline stems from cultural characteristics, or whether it serves to enhance control and efficiency for specific groups.

Foucault systematically analyzed the effects that surveillance and discipline produce, but he did not clearly identify the intentions of policymakers. Yet policy intentions are influenced by social context, policymakers’ interests, and political leanings. Therefore, the mere existence of institutional legitimacy does not necessarily guarantee that the institution also possesses ethical or moral legitimacy.

In addition, in many East Asian societies influenced by Confucian moral orders, concepts such as hierarchical social roles (e.g., “a ruler should act like a ruler, a minister like a minister, a father like a father, and a son like a son” — reflecting Confucian role ethics) emphasize fulfilling one’s assigned role rather than individual achievement or structural mobility. Although this framework may contribute to social order, it can also play a role in suppressing social mobility and internalizing disciplinary norms (Confucian role ethics).

These mechanisms of control also invite consideration of the relationship between social control and individual well-being. For example, the World Happiness Report 2025 shows that Western countries with strong individualistic tendencies tend to have higher happiness scores, while more collectivist societies often record lower scores (World Happiness Report 2025). 
This suggests that disciplinary mechanisms may operate more efficiently in collectivist social contexts, yet also exist in tension with individual subjective well-being.

Moreover, legal institutions such as prisons are structurally designed in ways that benefit privileged groups. The costs of hiring lawyers, litigation expenses, and time requirements create high barriers for non-elite individuals. Under these conditions, the functions of surveillance and punishment may be formally neutral but practically applied more strongly against low-income and socially disadvantaged groups.

In this way, contemporary relationships between freedom and power are complex. Policies cannot be understood solely as products of ideological conflict, economic competition, or political strategies. Instead, modern mechanisms of social control must be examined from multiple perspectives, rather than judged by a single standard.
