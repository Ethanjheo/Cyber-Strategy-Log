## Book Notes (Content-Focused Summary)

### Core Shift: From Spectacle to Discipline
Foucault’s opening scene—Damiens’ public execution—shows that pre-modern punishment operated as a visible ritual of sovereign power over the body.  
Modern punishment appears more humane and rational, but the central change is not the reduction of cruelty. It is the transformation of **where and how power operates**.

In modernity, power moves away from spectacular violence and into institutions that quietly shape behavior. Punishment becomes less about inflicting pain and more about producing compliant subjects through supervision, correction, and training.

### Institutions and Normalization
Disciplinary power is embedded across ordinary institutions, not only prisons:
- schools (rules and routines)
- workplaces (hierarchy and evaluation)
- hospitals, the military, factories (structured control)

Control often operates through **normalization**—standards of what is “average” or “acceptable.”  
Deviation is managed not only through punishment, but also through exclusion and social evaluation, which encourages self-regulation.

### Part III: Discipline and “Docile Bodies”
Foucault introduces **docile bodies**: bodies that are manipulable, trainable, and efficient—obedient and capable of self-regulation.  
Power optimizes individuals rather than eliminating them, shaping them through everyday routines and long-term disciplinary processes.

### Disciplinary Techniques (Key Set)
Foucault frames discipline as a technology of power, built through:
1) **Spatial organization** (the art of distributions)  
2) **Time and activity control** (timetables, routines)  
3) **Progressive training** (step-by-step evaluation, career ladders)  
4) **Forces composition** (optimizing individuals within the group)

### Mechanisms of Control
Discipline is reinforced through:
- **Hierarchical observation** (visibility, the possibility of being watched)
- **Normalizing judgment** (standards of normality)
- **The examination** (surveillance + judgment + documentation)

### Panopticism
Panopticism is the ideal form of disciplinary power:  
a system that leads individuals to behave as if they are always being observed, producing self-control with minimal direct force.
